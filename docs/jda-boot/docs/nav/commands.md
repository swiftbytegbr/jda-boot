# Commands

## Slash Commands

Slash Commands are the regular Discord commands which can be executed via the chat with `/`. To create a command in
JDA-Boot, a `@SlashCommandDefinition` annotation must be annotated to a class that extends the `SlashCommandExecutor`
class. In addition, the commands must be registered with Discord via `JDABoot.getInstance.updateCommands()` or
`JDABoot.getInstance.updateCommands(guildId)`.

### Command Configuration

The `@SlashCommandDefinition` annotation has many customization options for the command. This is a list of all fields
with a description of what each field does. If a command is not global, it can be registered via
`JDABoot.getInstance.registerCommand(guildId, commandId)`. The command id corresponds to the name of the command.

#### @SlashCommandDefinition

The fields `name` and `type` are required. It also makes sense to set `description`.

### Command Execution

If the Command class is extended with SlashCommandExecutor, the `onCommand` method must be implemented. This is executed
every time the command is used on Discord. The `SlashCommandInteractionEvent` is a field of the superclass with the name
`event`. Optionally, the method `onEnable(SlashCommandData data)` can also be implemented. As the name suggests, this is
executed when the command is initialized by JDA-Boot. In addition, the method
`onAutoComplete(AutoCompleteQuery query, CommandAutoCompleteInteractionEvent event)` can be overwritten. This is only
necessary if `autoComplete = true` in a command option. The functionality is the same as with JDA. In addition to these
methods, there are also other utility methods that simplify the use of [Embed Systems](embeds.md).

!!! example
=== "Java"
```java
@SlashCommandDefinition(
name = "ping",
description = "Check the bot's ping.",
type = SlashCommandDefinition.Type.SLASH
)
public class PingCommand extends SlashCommandExecutor {

            @Override
            public void onCommand() {
                long time = System.currentTimeMillis();

                event.reply("Pong!").setEphemeral(true).queue(response ->
                        response.editOriginal("Pong: " + (System.currentTimeMillis() - time) + " ms").queue());

            }

            @Override
            public void onEnable(SlashCommandData data) {
                System.out.println("Ping command enabled!");
            }
        }
        ```

## Console Commands

JDABoot supports a simple small console command system. It is important that the setting `enableConsoleCommands` of the
`@JDABootConfiguration` annotation is enabled. Then a class that implements the `ConsoleCommandExecutor` class can be
annotated with the `@ConsoleCommandDefinition` annotation. This has the field `name` which sets the name of the command
and the field `aliases` which takes an array of strings and sets alternative names for the command. The command itself
is implemented in the method `onCommand(String[] args)`. The arguments specified during execution are passed as an
array.

!!! example
=== "Java"
```java
@ConsoleCommandDefinition(name = "registerCommands")
public class RegisterCommandsCommand implements ConsoleCommandExecutor {

            @Override
            public void onCommand(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Registering commands!");
                JDABoot.getInstance().updateCommands();
            }
        }
        ```

## User and Message Context Commands

In addition to the classic slash commands, there are now also user and message context commands. These are commands that
can be executed by right-clicking on a user or a message. The creation of such a command is very similar to the slash
commands, in fact so similar that the same `SlashCommandDefinition` annotation is used. Only the type has to be changed
and some options cannot be set. However, the `SlashCommandExecutor` may no longer be extended, but the
`UserContextCommandExecutor` or `MessageContextCommandExecutor` must be implemented.
