# JDA-Boot Documentation

This project uses [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) by [Austin Keener](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/).

## Why JDA-Boot?
JDA-Boot aims to simplify Discord Bot development by providing pre-built tools. This allows developers to focus on the essentials of bot development without having to spend hours on a custom command system, for example. Nevertheless, we still use JDA, which is why everything that is already possible with JDA can be implemented. This ensures maximum flexibility. In addition, JDA-Boot is built in such a way that it can easily be extended if the existing functionality is not sufficient.

## Installation
JDA-Boot can easily be added to your project via the Maven Central Repository. Please replace 'VERSION' with the current
jda-boot version.
